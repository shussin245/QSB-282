	abstract = {Introduction
Despite the clinical efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), only around 20\% of patients remain disease free at 5 years. Here we use digital spatial profiling to find candidate biomarker proteins associated with ICI resistance.

Materials and Methods
Pre-treatment samples from 56 patients with NSCLC treated with ICI were analyzed using the NanoString GeoMx® digital spatial profiling (DSP) method. A panel of 71 photocleavable oligonucleotide-labeled primary antibodies was used for protein detection in 4 molecular compartments (tumor, leukocytes, macrophages, and immune stroma). Promising candidates were orthogonally validated with quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF). Available pre-treatment samples from 39 additional patients with NSCLC that received ICI, and 236 non-ICI treated operable NSCLC patients were analyzed to provide independent cohort validation.

Results
Biomarker discovery using the protein-based molecular compartmentalization strategy allows 284 protein variables to be assessed for association with ICI resistance by univariate analysis using continuous log-scaled data. Of 71 candidate protein biomarkers, CD66b in the CD45+CD68 molecular compartment (immune stroma) predicted significantly shorter OS (HR 1.31, p=0.016) and was chosen for validation. Orthogonal validation by QIF showed that CD66b was associated with resistance to ICI therapy but not prognostic for poor outcome in untreated NSCLC [discovery cohort (OS; HR 2.49, p=0.026), validation cohort (OS; HR 2.05, p=0.046), non-ICI treated cohort (OS; HR 1.67, p=0.06)].

Discussion
Using the DSP technique, we have discovered that CD66b expression is indicative of resistance to ICI therapy in NSCLC. Since CD66b identifies neutrophils, further studies are warranted to characterize the role of neutrophils in ICI resistance.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The dimeric Ser/Thr kinase Nek2 regulates centrosome cohesion and separation through phosphorylation of structural components of the centrosome, and aberrant regulation of Nek2 activity can lead to aneuploid defects characteristic of cancer cells. Mutational analysis of autophosphorylation sites within the kinase domain identified by mass spectrometry shows a complex pattern of positive and negative regulatory effects on kinase activity that are correlated with effects on centrosomal splitting efficiency \textit{in vivo}. The 2.2-Ä resolution x-ray structure of the Nek2 kinase domain in complex with a pyrrole-indolinone inhibitor reveals an inhibitory helical motif within the activation loop. This helix presents a steric barrier to formation of the active enzyme and generates a surface that may be exploitable in the design of specific inhibitors that selectively target the inactive state. Comparison of this "auto-inhibitory" conformation with similar arrangements in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase suggests a role for dimerization-dependent allosteric regulation that combines with autophosphorylation and protein phosphatase 1c phosphatase activity to generate the precise spatial and temporal control required for Nek2 function in centrosomal maturation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Drug-discovery and drug-development endeavors are laborious, costly and time consuming. These programs can take upward of 12 years and cost US \$2.5 billion, with a failure rate of more than 90\%. Machine learning (ML) presents an opportunity to improve the drug-discovery process. Indeed, with the growing abundance of public and private large-scale biological and chemical datasets, ML techniques are becoming well positioned as useful tools that can augment the traditional drug-development process. In this Perspective, we discuss the integration of algorithmic methods throughout the preclinical phases of drug discovery. Specifically, we highlight an array of ML-based efforts, across diverse disease areas, to accelerate initial hit discovery, mechanism-of-action (MOA) elucidation and chemical property optimization. With advances in the application of ML across diverse therapeutic areas, we posit that fully ML-integrated drug-discovery pipelines will define the future of drug-development programs.},
